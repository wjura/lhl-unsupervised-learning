## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes
### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked."

### Part I: EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis & Pre-processing
- Data Import: Loaded the dataset for an initial analysis using basic libraries.
- Data Description and Cleaning: Generated summary statistics and addressed any missing values and inaccuracies in the data.
- Data Visualization: Created visualizations to explore the relationships between different variables.
- Correlation Analysis: Analyzed correlations among various variables.
- Outlier Detection: Identified and managed outliers within the dataset.
- Data Transformation: Standardized the data to prepare it for clustering analysis.
### Part II: PCA
Used Principal Component Analysis to identify the key combinations of features that most effectively describe customer purchasing behavior.

### Part III: KMeans Clustering
Investigated customer segmentation using KMeans clustering, determining the optimal number of clusters and examining the characteristics of each cluster.

### Part IV: Hierarchical Clustering
Conducted hierarchical clustering to gain deeper insights into customer groupings, utilizing dendrogram analysis for interpretation.

### Part V: Conclusion
Summarized the main findings from the analysis.
